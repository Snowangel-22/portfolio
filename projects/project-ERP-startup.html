                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>Develop a working proof of concept and pitch for a customer to migrate their existing ERP to a cloud solution.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Challenge</h3>
                    <p>There are three deliverables:</p>
                    <ol style="padding-left: 20px;">
                      <li>Exec ready slide deck</li>
                      <li>Data model and working spreadsheet</li>
                      <li>Product memo</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The customer is currently using a legacy ERP with customer workflows in spreadsheets.
                      The goal is to pitch them the new solution by building a proof of concept and showcase that the startup can anticipate future needs.
                    </p>      
                    <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>The order which I tackled the project is data model, deck, and memo. It was both a logical order and sorted based on estimated
                      completion time. Since it was my first take-home assignment (ever). I struggled with understanding what the interviews are looking for
                      in each deliverable. It didn't make sense to prioritize one over another, but at the same time, I did not have the luxury to perfect any.
                    </p>
                    <p>I believe it was recommended to spend around 6-8 hours on this assignement, and I easily spent more than double the time throughout
                      whole process from opening the email to sending in the final files.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Solution</h3>                    
                    <div class="pdf-container">
                      <iframe
                        src="../images/project/project-ERP-startup/ERP_Case_Study_redacted.pdf"
                        width="100%"
                        height="500"
                      ></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <div class="pdf-container">

                    </div>

                    <h3>Improvements</h3>
                    <p>Slide deck: can add a timeline that outlines now, proof of concpet, future (with more features). The customer will not only be paying for moving their workflow into the new platform, but they will also need to know future value.</p>
                    <p>Data model: in addition to working model, the focus was more on the prediction aspect. So needed a working prediction model that takes past purchase data and outputs stocking level and frequency.</p>
                    <p>Product memo: strucutre more like a PRD, and dive more into details like features, launch readiness, and impact.</p>
